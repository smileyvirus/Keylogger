# Keylogger in Python

Keylogger is used to read keystrokes from the keyboard.

This is a simple program in Python that can be used to read keystrokes and sent via mail.

First the details of the Mail-id and the password of the mail id must be updated in the send.py file.This file will be invoked later.

The bash script must be run to get the desired output using :-

$bash keylogger.sh

After keystrokes are entered the grave key must be entered to end and sent the output via mail to the user.
